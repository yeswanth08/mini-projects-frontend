Yes, **`useRef`**'s primary duty in this case is to store a **reference to a DOM element** (or any mutable value) without causing a re-render when that reference changes. It provides a way to interact with the DOM in a **React-friendly** manner.

Let me break it down further:

### **Main Duties of `useRef` in React:**

1. **Storing a DOM reference**:
   - `useRef` can be used to store a reference to a DOM element in order to directly access it (for example, to get its size, position, or to trigger a method like `focus()`).
   - In your case, `useRef` is used to store a reference to the `Form` component's DOM node, so you can access its `offsetTop` (position) when you want to scroll the page to it.

2. **Persistent value across renders**:
   - A `ref` does not trigger re-renders when it changes. So, it's great for storing values that don’t need to cause a re-render, like a reference to a DOM element, the previous value of a state, or a value that should persist across renders but isn’t needed in the UI.
   - This is why `useRef` is perfect for tracking the `form` element's position in this example, as it allows you to refer to the DOM element when needed without affecting the component's render cycle.

### **Recap of how `useRef` works in your case:**

1. **Storing a DOM reference:**
   ```tsx
   const formRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
   ```
   - Here, `formRef` is initialized to `null` and will later hold a reference to the `Form` component's DOM node after it’s rendered.

2. **Accessing the DOM element**:
   After the `Form` is rendered (when `isFriend` is `true`), the `formRef` points to the actual DOM element, and you can access properties like `offsetTop` to scroll the page.
   ```tsx
   formRef.current.offsetTop
   ```

3. **Scrolling based on the reference**:
   The page scrolls to the form's position by accessing `formRef.current.offsetTop`, and using `window.scrollTo`:
   ```tsx
   window.scrollTo({
       top: formRef.current.offsetTop,
       behavior: "smooth",
   });
   ```

### **Summary**:

- **`useRef`**'s **primary duty** in this case is **to store a reference to the DOM element** (`Form` in your case) so that you can interact with it directly (like getting its position to scroll the page).
- **It does not trigger re-renders** when the reference changes, which makes it different from state (which would trigger a re-render).

So, in your example, `useRef` is simply used to **store the reference to the `Form` component** after it’s rendered, allowing you to perform actions like scrolling to that element.

so in React => whenever you want to interact with the dom interact using useRef
